Ergonomic gamepad to play Touhou Project games. Allows for left-hand shoot/slow/bomb and right hand arrow conteols. The bomb button is supposed to be pressed with the left thumb.

Materials needed:

- 9 mechanical switches
- 9 keycaps
- a 3d printer
- an Arduino Pro Micro
- optionally, 9 Amoeba single switch PCBs for a cleaner wiring job

Use any mechanical switch you want. I'm using scraps and use a gateron yellow for slow movement, a gateron brown for shooting, and blues for the rest.

If you use the amoebas for the wiring, make sure to bridge the diode pads/holes since they're not used. This is easily done by placing some solder on the SMD diode pads until they are connected (you can also use a small strand of wire or a piece of diode leg)

3d printing directions:
- use 0.2mm layer height.
- print the plate face down and VERY slow on the first layer for the letters to come out decent.
- no support needed, just punch open the screw holes after printing.
